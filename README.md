To gather the data, I utilized the GitHub API to scrape user profiles and repository information. Specifically, I queried users in Barcelona with more than 100 followers and extracted details such as their names, companies, public repositories, and more. The resulting data was saved into two CSV files for analysis.
One notable insight was the diversity of programming languages used among developers. While JavaScript was the most common language, several users utilized niche languages, highlighting varied interests in the developer community.
Developers should consider making their profiles more accessible by including contact information and being active in community forums. This could foster better connections and collaborative opportunities within the GitHub community.
